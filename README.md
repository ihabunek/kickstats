Kickstats
=========

Tracks and charts pledges for a kickstarter project.

See a demo [here](http://bezdomni.net/kickstats/).

Files
-----

**fetch.php** - Loads the project data from kickstarter and saves it to the data dir. This file can be scheduled to run every hour using crontab.

**index.php** - Displays a list of configured projects.

**chart.php** - Displays individual project data in a chart.

**kickstats.ini** - The configuration file, defines configured projects.

Configuration
-------------

Sample project configuration:

	[wasteland-2]
	name = "Wasteland 2"
	url = http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/inxile/wasteland-2/
	goals[900000] = Project funded
	goals[2100000] = Obsidian joins
	finished = 1

The following options are available for each project:

* **[project-id]** - A project ID, in this case "wasteland-2". Should not contain spaces, data will be saved to 'data/wasteland-2.dat'.
* **name** - Project name, which will be dispayed in the GUI.
* **url** - Path to the kickstarter page for the project.
* **goals** - An array of funding targets which will be drawn on the chart. The array key is the amount required, and the value is the goal description.
* **finished** - If set to 1, fetch.php will no longer fetch data for this project.

The idea and the initial data set was taken from [Adam at ruinedkingdoms.com](http://ruinedkingdoms.com/wasteland2/). Adapted to use highcharts which are nicer and easier to use.
