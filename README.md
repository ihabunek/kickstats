Kickstarter statistics
======================

Tracks and charts pledges for a kickstarter project.

This example tracks the [Wasteland 2](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/inxile/wasteland-2/) project by Brian Fargo. 

Files
-----
**fetch.php** - Loads the kickstarter page and saves relevant data to wasteland-2.dat. This file can be scheduled to run every hour e.g. using crontab.
**index.php** - Loads the data from wasteland-2.dat and displays it in a chart.

Credits
-------
The idea and the initial data set was taken from [Adam at ruinedkingdoms.com](http://ruinedkingdoms.com/wasteland2/). Adapted to use highcharts which are nicer and easier to use.
